And while Guy Pearce might not be around as much these days, not much else has changed. Downstairs lurks the dance floor, with its grinding bodies, slick DJs, and disco ball overhang, while the more low-key and effortlessly handsome upstairs bar and dining area hosts regular drag performances, trivia, and bingo nights. The sleeper hit here is the Imperial Rooftop, a breezy escape where Sunday afternoon crowds vibe over spritzes and slices backed by the chillest live DJs.";
